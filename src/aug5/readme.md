## Recap 

Encapsulation 
1. data hiding process

wrap data in single unit 
restrict the access to the data members by make variables
private

getters/setters to provide access. 


abstraction
2. Hiding the internal implementation and showing only essential feature of the 
object

How to achieve abstraction? 
  abstract class  [0-100%]
   interfaces  [100%]



Abstract class 
1. it's a class with abstract keyword
2. it cannot be instantiated,[object cannot be created for abstract class]
3. it may or may not contain abstract methods
4. if a class have at least one abstract method, class must be abstract.


advantage of abstraction. 

                JDBC - Java database connection
            methods, abstract methods, interfaces

conenction, connectionFactory, restultset

MYSQL           Postgres        SQLite          MyPragraDatabase



## Abstract abstraction
class : Payment 
1.      validate() : abstract
2.      processPayment(double amount) : Concrete

## class 
CreditCardPayment  : sout("Payment validate for CC )
PaypalPayment
DebitCardPayment

validate the type of card. 
process payment
