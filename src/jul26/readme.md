#**# Object Oriented Programming [OOP]

classes 
Objects 

Pillars of OOP
1. Inheritance 
   Inheriting the properties from the parent class 

   Parent 
     |
  Child


2. Polymorphism
    

Student(){

}

Student(int a, int ){

}


Student(10,20);


constructor overloading

method overloading      ---- method overriding 
static polymorphism          Runtime poly.


3. Abstraction 

showing only what is necessary 
hide complex details from the users.

4. Encapsulation**

hiding your data into single unit 
and you access , who can access what. 




## Inheritance - code resuability 

1. Single 
2. Multi level 


Multiple inheritance - ## Java does not support this directly in classes.
