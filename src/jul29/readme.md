2. Polymorphism 
3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation

super keyword


static polymorphism vs Dynamic Polymorphism

method overloading vs Method overriding 



## encapsulation 

Data hiding  
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
Hiding the data and encapsulate into single unit. 
You can decide who can access what

process of hiding the internal implementation details of the class. 
1. All the fields private 
2. you can provide access through getters/setters methods

FileMangementSystem 
1. ReadOnly      - view only file, name cannot be changed    - getters
2. WriteOnly     - upload only , file name cannot be seen/visible - setters
3. ReadAndWriteFiles - editable file   - both  - getters/setters
create classes based on these file type 

should protect the internal filename from unauthorized access or modification.


class ReadOnlyFile {

private String fileName;




## Abstraction 

data hiding
hiding complexity and showing only essential features

abstraction can be achieved by two ways 
1. abstract classes [0-100%] 
2. Interfaces [100%]


## abstract classes 
how to create abstract classes 

1. using abstract keyword
